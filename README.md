# API Learning Project (Node.js)

A simple JavaScript client that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against a REST API.

This project was built to learn **API integration**, **HTTP Methods**, and **Asynchronous JavaScript** using Node.js.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
* **JavaScript** (ES6+)
* **Node.js** (Runtime environment)
* **Fetch API** (Native Node.js implementation)
* **JSONPlaceholder** (Fake Online REST API for testing)

## 📋 Features
The script `index.js` performs the following automated tasks:
1.  **GET**: Fetches a post from the server.
2.  **POST**: Simulates creating a new post with JSON data.
3.  **PUT**: Updates an existing post.
4.  **DELETE**: Removes a post from the server.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**
    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v18 or higher is required for native `fetch`).

2.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/officialakash96/api-learning-project.git](https://github.com/officialakash96/api-learning-project.git)
    ```

3.  **Run the Script**
    Navigate to the folder and execute the file:
    ```bash
    cd api-learning-project
    node index.js
    ```

## 📝 Example Output
